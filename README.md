# Edward Hopper Algorithic Art

## Overview
The artwork of [Edward Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hopper) and the old architecture of Pennsylvania with ornate windows inspired this project. My objective was to create a 3D animation that converys depth and space similar to rooms dispicted in Hopper's paintings. Additionally I made the Javascript code such that traits of the windows could be easily modified.

## Visual Description 
In the animation, multiple 3D objects make up the the image of the window, interior, and the scene beyond the window. 

## Conceptual Inspiration
I am a fan of Edward Hopper's work and as pointed out by other admirers of his work, Hopper incorporates windows into his paintings. These windows tend to be large and reveal a spacious interior. As one looks through the depicted window in the foreground, sometimes another window is vissble in the background that frames the space beyond the interior.

While working on this project I learned that 

## Technical Overview
I made the cThis project can run directly on any web browser, making it accessible and easy to share. I used the Three.js library to create the 3D environment that would run in a browser.
